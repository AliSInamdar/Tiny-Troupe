# Microsoft TinyTroupe: Persona Debate

This project leverages the Microsoft TinyTroupe model to create two AI-generated personas and simulate a debate between them. The personas are designed to represent different viewpoints on a given topic and engage in a dynamic conversation. The model is used to generate dialogues based on predefined prompts, allowing the personas to argue their points and counter each otherâ€™s arguments.

The goal of this project is to explore how AI can simulate human-like debates, fostering a better understanding of various perspectives in a structured and meaningful way.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Microsoft TinyTroupe, an AI model that facilitates conversational AI applications. In this case, it has been applied to simulate a debate between two distinct personas. These personas have specific traits, beliefs, and knowledge, and they discuss a topic of choice.

The personas are designed to represent opposing viewpoints on a particular topic, and the debate allows for a dynamic exchange of arguments, rebuttals, and counter-arguments.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft TinyTroupe (for natural language processing and dialogue generation)

- Python 3.x

## Model Description
Microsoft TinyTroupe is a conversational model that allows the creation of AI personas capable of holding a dialogue. The personas are designed with different attributes that influence their conversation styles, argument strategies, and responses.

In this project, two personas are created:

Persona 1: Represents a Student

Persona 2: Represents a Professor

These personas engage in a debate where they argue about a topic of choice, offering counterpoints and rebuttals as the conversation progresses.
